#Ada Lovelace's Biography

As result of the course Progr{Amo} by Programaria was made this site
to tell the history of Ada Lovelace.

When finished Programaria set 3 challeging: insert a favicon, use hover
on the links and use variable to make the form.

Than I proposed myself some challeging: Make a responsive navbar and
a button to return the navbar.
